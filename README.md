# Eye Movement Exercise
```
```
##Description
```
This is a small project completed by me during the MIT JavaScript Coding Bootcamp. This exercise uses a mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create two human-like eyes which follow your cursor around the page. 
```
##Usage
```
To download, click the "Fork" button on the top right corner to clone the repository. When done, open the folder in which the files are stored, and open the index.html file in your browser. Feel free to play around with the eyes when it's open!
```
##Roadmap
```
While project might seem very basic, I believe a lot could come from it. Continued work could turn this into a toddler's learning game, which could help teach toddlers colors, shapes, numbers and so on, using the eye movement as a key feature.

##License

"Eye Movement Ecercise" is free and open source available for anyone to use for any project.
